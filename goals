The aim of the algorithms and datastructures library is:

Supply standard algorithms and datastructures
Supply novel and obscure algorithms and datastrcutures
Have an experimental and engineering approach
Supply thorough ducomentation and beutifull API's

Engineering approach

"Baseline approach" - meaning "dont cheat", reproduceable and predeictable test/benchmarks
All programs should be micro-benchmarkable, generic and composeable
